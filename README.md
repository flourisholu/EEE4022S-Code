# PC-Based Ultrasonic Radar Demonstrator for Measuring Speed of Vehicles in Parking Areas
This repository contains the MATLAB code that was written for an undergraduate final-year project (EEE4022S) at the University of Cape Town. The aim of the project was to design an ultrasonic radar demonstrator that can accurately measure the speed of slow-moving vehicles in parking areas.

A description of the various scripts and functions contained within this directory is given below. The report was written using Latex and can be found [here](https://github.com/flourisholu/EEE4022S-Report.git).
