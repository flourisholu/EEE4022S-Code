# EEE4022S-Code
This repository contains code and measured data for a final year project completed in partial fulfillment of a BSc Electrical & Computer Engineering degree at the University of Cape Town. The aim was to design and build an ultrasonic radar demonstrator for detecting the speed of moving vehicles in parking areas.

## What is in this repository?
**`/.Audio Signal Processing`**  
Contains MATLAB scripts and functions for measuring speed using an audio radar system. Spectrogram output is also available here.

---
**`/.Ultrasonic Signal Processing`**  
Same code used in **`/.Audio Signal Processing`**, but incles a MATLAB application designed to allow the user to customise some of the radar parameters. Speed, spectrogram, and signal processing plots are output once logging is complete, and speeds are displayed on the GUI.

---
**`/.data`**
Contains collected data from testing the ultrasonic radar system in field tests.

## Supporting files
This code and the subsequent data files were created in conjunction with a written report (in LATEX) that can be found here: https://github.com/flourisholu/EEE4022S-Report.git
