# EEE4022S-Code
This repository contains code and measured data for a final year project completed in partial fulfillment of a BSc Electrical & Computer Engineering degree at the University of Cape Town. The aim was to design and build an ultrasonic radar demonstrator for detecting the speed of moving vehicles in parking areas.

## What is in this repository?
**`/.Audio Signal Processing`**  
Contains MATLAB scripts and functions for measuring speed using an audio radar system. Spectrogram output is also available here.

---
**`/.Ultrasonic Signal Processing`**  
Same code used in **`/.Audio Signal Processing`**

---
**`/.data`**
Contains collected data from testing the ultrasonic radar system in field tests.

## Supporting files
This code and the subsequent data files were created in conjunction with a written report (in LATEX) that can be found here: https://github.com/flourisholu/EEE4022S-Report.git
